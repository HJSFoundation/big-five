# Big Five Personality Inventory

The Big Five personality traits, or five-factor model, is based on lexical descriptors of personality. This theory suggests five broad dimensions can be used to describe a person's pervasive behaviors and psyche. The initial model was advanced by Ernest Tupes and Raymond Christal in 1961. In 1990, J.M. Digman advanced the model, and Lewis Goldberg extended to the current level of organization. 

The five factors have been defined as: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. These five overarching domains have been found to contain and subsume most known personality traits and are assumed to represent the basic structure behind all personality traits. This brief survey implemented in html will help give you an idea of what your five dimensions may be.
